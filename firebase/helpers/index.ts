// This file's content has been moved to services/firebaseService.ts
// It is kept to prevent import errors if other parts of a larger system still reference it,
// but its direct usage by App.tsx and core components has been removed.
// For the purpose of this refactor, consider this file deprecated for new Firebase logic.
// All Firebase interactions should go through services/firebaseService.ts.
