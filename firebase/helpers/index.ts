// Firebase-dependent functions have been removed as per the requirement
// to use services/firebaseService.ts exclusively for Firebase interactions.

// If logFirebaseError is used by App.tsx and is considered a utility that
// itself doesn't make direct SDK calls that should be in firebaseService.ts,
// it can remain. Otherwise, this file might become empty or be removed
// if App.tsx no longer imports anything from here.

// For now, assuming logFirebaseError is a utility that can stay.
import { logFirebaseError } from '../logging'; // Assuming this is okay to keep if it's just a logger.

// All other functions that directly used 'firebase/auth', 'firebase/firestore', 'firebase/storage'
// (e.g., createJobInFirestore, updateUserProfileInFirestore, uploadProfilePhotoToStorage, etc.)
// have been removed because App.tsx should now call equivalent functions
// from 'services/firebaseService.ts'.

// If there were any non-Firebase utility functions here, they would remain.
// Example:
// export const someUtilityFunction = (input: string): string => {
//   return input.toUpperCase();
// };

// If logFirebaseError is also intended to be part of the service layer or not used,
// this file might become empty.
export { logFirebaseError }; // Re-exporting if it's still used by App.tsx and acceptable.
